# Thumbnail Annotation 
Master Project Web Interfacecs for Language Processing Systems in Language Technology department at the University of Hamburg 

## Basic Idea
The Idea is to show 'context sensitive' Thumbnails for specific words (nouns, named entities) that appear in a text. For example let's have the sentence "I drive my Jaguar into the garage.". If a user clicks on the word "Jaguar", a Thumbnail of a Jaguar Car (and not a cat) shows up. The problem here is (as usual in Natural Language) ambigious meanings of words.

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is a PoC Application with a Web-Interface frontend as well as an API and a backend to do word the disambiguation and Thumbnail-crawling. The Technologies used to achieve this goal will most probably be UIMA, Spring(Boot), ThymeLeaf, Bootstrap and Docker.
